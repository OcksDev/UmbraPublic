The tools package is mostly made for me, Ocks, but anyone is more than welcome to use it.
If you have any feedback or things I can add/change please submit it to me and I will see what I can do.


As of 1.0.4 the package includes:
- Dialog System
- Save System
- Console System
- Chat System
- Base Multiplayer Setup
- General Inventory Systems (GIS)
- Base NavMesh Setup
- A lot of random functions
- Sound System
- Modified Object Spawning (to allow for passing in data on spawn)
- Input Manager
- Custom Tags System (because unity's tags are bad)
- Some common base classes such as an Entity class
- A Bunch of Util Windows
- A Bunch of random scripts for things
